Not doing this is like asking out a crush without deodorant; it may not matter, but we aren't going to take our chances."

Because number of customers is difficult to pin down, we will use the population of the cluster.\n\nIn real life, there are many ways we could get a better estimate for this number, including by going to a location and counting how many people walk by a building in a given hour.\n\n\n\n### There are other factors that are important, but we do not care.
